Small **Window Preview** Tweak:

**Instead of:**

**Get:**

- *Filter is used to blend to the theme and for ease on the natural blur
- "Fill" option stretches very small windows alot and it becomes a mess for those but it is better if you dont have small windows
- "Cover" option is like a zoom so not all of the window is shown in the expanded form but it's the better option overall
